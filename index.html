    <p id="paragraph1" onclick="changeText('paragraph1');">did you know donkos koffie put a lot of coffee in the atomic bomb that  bombed hiroshima. They did this so the people would become coffee beans. When everyone in hirsohima died, Maurice the first grabbed all of the remains and sold them in his coffeshop.
        this was dangerous for your health and maurice the first knew this. Doctors tried to warn the coffee freaks but maurice hired his son Louis to kill every one of them. Roeselare was in on the deal because donkos koffie was the only business with a profit for the city. lots of tourists died in the coffee shop.
        they were robbed and turned into coffee. maurice the second is laughing everyday when he's at school. i will have my revenge donkos freaks just trust me. my heart is cold and so will be your bodies.
